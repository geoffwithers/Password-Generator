# Password-Generator
Assignment 3, a random password generator using HTML, CSS, and JS

In this assignment, we were provided with the HTML and CSS pages for a Password Generator, and tasked with creating the JavaScript that would meet the acceptance criteria. 

In this password generator, the user is prompted for the length of their password, and if they'd like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. 

I used the .prompt feature to get confirmation on the selected password criteria, then a for loop to combine the selected criteria in a randomized order and to the user's desired length.
